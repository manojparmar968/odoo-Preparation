# Primary Key --> Constrains uniquely identifies each record in a table. 
    Primary key must contains unique values & can not contains NULL values.

# unique Key/Alternate Key/Secondary key --> The unique Constraint ensures that all values in a column 
    are different and non-null values.
    Both Primary key & unique key Constraints provide uniqueness for a column or set of columns.
    secondary (alternate) keys because they must be unique but are not the primary key.

# Foreign Key --> is a field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.

# ACID Properties
    1. Atomic --> A transaction is a logical unit of work which must be either completed with all of its
        data modifications or none of them performed.
    2. Consistent --> At the end of the transaction all data must be left in a consistent state.
    3. Isolated --> Modifications of data performed by a transaction must be independent of another
        transaction unless this happens, the outcome of a transaction may be errorness.
    4. Durability --> When the transaction is completed effects of the modifications performed by the
        transaction must be permanent in the system.

# Index
    You can speed the database search performance. 
    However, you should be careful not to add indexes on too many fields because the size of the database 
        can rapidly increase. 
    Which means, you should carefully detect the most searchable fields and to create indexes for them only.
    Indexes are a common way to enhance database performance. An index allows the database server to find 
        and retrieve specific rows much faster.
