        amount of the product, shipment, insurance, custom duties, service charge, currency conversion, 
        transportation fee etc.

        company to another company.
    
    Inventory > Settings > valuation > Landed Cost.

# Batch Picking
    Batch Picking is the process of selecting a group of products for meeting the requirement of order.
    The order can be small batches or large batches.
    Batch picking enables a single picker to handle multiple orders at once, reducing the number of times 
        needed to navigate to a warehouse location. 
    When picking in batches, orders are grouped and consolidated into a picking list. 
    After the picking, the batch is taken to an output location, where the products are sorted into their 
        respective delivery packages.

    Inventory > Configuration > Settings > operations > Batch Picking.

# Cluster picking
    Cluster picking is an advanced picking method that combines the efficiency of batch picking with 
        immediate sorting during the picking process. 
    It is best suited for warehouses with high order volumes where organization and speed are critical.

# Wave transfers
    While a batch transfer is a group of several pickings, a wave transfer contains certain parts of 
        different pickings. 
    wave transfers are batch transfers with an extra step: transfers are split before being grouped in a batch.
    Wave picking is ideal for warehouses that need to optimize the handling of high order volumes while 
        managing complex picking criteria. 
    With wave transfers, orders are grouped into waves based on factors like product location, category, 
        or scheduled shipping times. 
    Each wave is assigned to a different employee for the most efficient execution.

# Batch transfer VS Batch Picking
    Batch Transfer:
        Groups orders together
        can be used for picking, internal transfers, or deliveries
    Batch Picking
        One of the three picking methods available in odoo i.e Batch, wave & Cluster.
        Physically gathering items for multiple orders at Once
        Behind the scenes, it's handled by "Batch Transfer" operations

# DropShipping

    2. where the product is delivered to a customer directly from the vendor's store is called DropShipping.

    Inventory > Configuration > settings > Warehouse > Enable Multi Step Routes.
    Purchase > Configuration > Settings > logistics > Enable DropShipping.

# Location types
    1. Physical Location:- is the area where one product is in hand, its the warehouse internal site.
        which can also be assigned to the loading & unloading location in a warehouse or shelf etc.

    2. Partner's Location:- It act like a Physical location. This could be seen as the spaces in which
        you were not the owner but stands between a seller or a customer warehouse.

    3. Virtual Location:- The space or area that do not exist in reality or Physical.

    Inventory > Configuration > Settings > Warehouse > Activate Storage locations.

    added as the default scrap location.

# inventory valuation --> The main aim of inventory valuation is to find revenue.

# forecasted quantity -->
    forecasted quantity = onhand quantity - outgoing shipment + incoming shipment.

# Inventory Adjustment --> are used to update stock quantities manually, typically when there is a 
    mismatch between the physical stock.
    This can be due to various reasons such as damaged goods, theft, or losses during transit.

    Operations menu >  Inventory Adjustments

# Automatic adjustments --> You can also set up automated stock adjustments based on inventory rules.

# Inventory report --> that help you understand the status of your stock after adjustments.

# Inventory Lead Time --> Requested Product, when it is expected to be received into inventory.


# What is the difference between reordering and replenishment in Odoo?
    Reordering rules and replenishment are features in Odoo that help manage inventory efficiently. 
    Reordering rules automatically generate purchase or manufacturing orders when a product's stock level 
        drops below a certain threshold. 
    Replenishment is a manual process that restocks products to maintain inventory levels.

# Costing Method in odoo
    1. Standard Costing --> Method is basic & easy just put the cost price on product master.
        Example:-
            Cost of Product A is set 7rs,
            PO create with 10rs with 10kg but in inventory show 10kg with 70rs

    2. Average Costing --> Method is calculated based on the average cost of all available similar items in 
        inventory.
        Example:-
            Cost of an item in inventory divided by the number of item availble in stock.

    3. Real-time (FIFO, LIFO, FEFO) Costing --> 
        1. odoo keeps the track of the cost of each incoming & outgoing item.
        2. The real-time costing method works along with the stock removal strategy i.e FIFO, LIFO & FEFO.
        3. So we have to select one of them from product category otherwise by default FIFO will select.

# Odoo Stock Removal Strategies?
    1. First In First Out (FIFO) :- Products/Lots that were stocked first will be moved out first.
    2. Last In First Out (LIFO) :- Products/Lots that were stocked last will be moved out first.
    3. Closest Location :- Products/Lots with the closest to the target location will be moved out first.
    4. First Expiry First Out (FEFO) :- Products/Lots with the closest removal date will be moved out 
        first(The availability of this method depends on the "Expiration Dates" Settings.)
    5. Least Packages :- FIFO but with the least number of packages possible when there are several 
        packages containing the same product.

# Consignment inventory?
    Consignment inventory is a supply chain model where a retailer sells a supplier's product, 
    but the supplier retains ownership until the product is sold. 
    The retailer only pays for the items they sell, and can return any unsold items to the supplier. 
    The supplier(consignor), receives payment from the retailer(consignee), based on an agreed-upon 
    arrangement, such as a fixed fee or percentage of the sale price. 

# Blanket Order?
    Blanket Order (also known as a Framework Agreement or Long-term Agreement) is a type of purchase agreement 
    where a supplier agrees to provide goods or services over a specified period, at predetermined prices or 
    terms. 

# Lot --> specific batch of an item recieved, stored or shipped from your warehouse & a lot has a unique
    number for tracking.

# Lot V/S serial number
    A Lot is useful for products you make or receive in large quantities.
    Serial number are good for products that require after sales services.

# Multi step Routes
    One-Step Receipts: you can configure the system to directly move the goods from the Incoming location 
        to the Stock location

    One-step process: When inventory is received from the vendor, it is immediately added to stock and made 
        available for use.​
        Vendor → Warehouse (Stock Available)​

    For Two-Step Receipts, you can create an intermediate step where goods are first moved to a Quality 
    location before being moved to Stock.

    Two-step process: Inventory is first moved to a designated receiving area for inspection. Once verified, 
        it is transferred to the main warehouse stock.​
        Vendor → Receiving Area → Warehouse (Stock Available)​

    For Three-Step Receipts, you can configure an additional intermediate location, such as a Reception 
    location, where items are received before moving to the Quality location and then finally to Stock.

    Three-step process: Inventory is first received in a staging area, then moved to a quality control zone 
        for thorough verification. After passing quality checks, it is added to the warehouse stock and made 
        available for use.​

        Vendor → Receiving Area → Quality Control → Warehouse (Stock Available)

# Define routes: Create routes to define the paths that goods take through your warehouse and supply chain.
