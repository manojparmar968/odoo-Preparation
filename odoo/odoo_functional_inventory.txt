        available for use.​
        Vendor → Warehouse (Stock Available)​

    For Two-Step Receipts, you can create an intermediate step where goods are first moved to a Quality 
    location before being moved to Stock.

    Two-step process: Inventory is first moved to a designated receiving area for inspection. Once verified, 
        it is transferred to the main warehouse stock.​
        Vendor → Receiving Area → Warehouse (Stock Available)​

    For Three-Step Receipts, you can configure an additional intermediate location, such as a Reception 
    location, where items are received before moving to the Quality location and then finally to Stock.

    Three-step process: Inventory is first received in a staging area, then moved to a quality control zone 
        for thorough verification. After passing quality checks, it is added to the warehouse stock and made 
        available for use.​
