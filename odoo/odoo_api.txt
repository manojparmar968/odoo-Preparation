# odoo API --> odoo uses Restful api.
    1. Get --> To get data from api.
    2. Post --> To send data to api when creating records.
    3. Put --> To update/ edit existing data.
    4. Delete --> To remove/delete data.

# Restful API --> is a API that uses HTTP request to get, Put, Post & delete data.
    It uses both OAuth1 & OAuth2 protocols to authenticate 3rd party application.

# auth = 'none' /auth = 'public'
    1. This means that no authentication is required to access the route or method.
    2. The route can be accessed by anyone, regardless of whether they are logged in or not.
    3.It is typically used for routes that are intended to be publicly accessible, 
        such as APIs that do not require user authentication.
    Example:
        @http.route('/my/public/route', auth='none'/'public', type='json')
        def public_route(self):

# auth='user': 
    1. This means the user must be logged in to access this route.
    2. Ensures the user is authenticated.

# auth='api': 
    1. This is used to authenticate API requests using an API key.
    2. API token authentication for external API access.

# Key Differences: auth = 'none' & auth = 'public'
    auth = 'none': Completely open access, no user verification (anyone can access).
    auth = 'public': Open access, but the user is identified as a public user if not logged in.
