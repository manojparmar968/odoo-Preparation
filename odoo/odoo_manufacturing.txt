# BOM --> A BoM is a list of the components and operations required to manufacture a product.
    Components --> specify components used to manufacture the product.
    Operations --> specify instructions for production and register time spent on an operation.
        Work Center --> select existing locations to perform the operation.
    Miscellaneous --> contains more BoM configurations to customize procurement, calculate costs, and define 
        how components are consumed.

# One-step manufacturing -->  Odoo creates a manufacturing order (MO), but does not generate transfers for the 
    movement of components out of inventory or finished products into stock. Inventory counts still update 
    based on the number of components used and products manufactured, but the act of transferring them to and 
    from inventory is not tracked.

# Two-step manufacturing --> Odoo creates a manufacturing order (MO) and a pick components transfer, but does 
    not generate a transfer for the movement of finished products into stock. Inventory counts still update 
    based on the number of products manufactured, but the act of transferring them to and from inventory is 
    not tracked.

# Three-step manufacturing --> Odoo creates a pick components transfer, a manufacturing order (MO), and a 
    store finished products transfer, and updates inventory counts based on the number of components removed, 
    and finished products created.
