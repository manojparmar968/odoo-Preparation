# RabbitMQ --> is an open-source message broker that acts as a middleman for applications, enabling them to 
    communicate asynchronously by sending and receiving messages, often using the 
    AMQP(Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) protocol.
    Port No. 5672

    sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues    # Ubuntu
