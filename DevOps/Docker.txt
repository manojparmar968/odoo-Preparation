db:
image: postgres:16
ports:
    - "5432:5432"
environment:
    - POSTGRES_USER=odoo
    - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=odoo
    - PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
volumes:
    - odoo-db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

db: is the name of the container.

image: contains the name of the image on docker hub, in this case its postgres. 16 is what they call a tag, 
    which is the version of postgres, you can go to the images tag section to list all the available versions.

ports: maps container port to host port, in our case we are using the same port for the container and the 
    host(5432). The port to the left is the host port and port to the right is the containers port.

environment: docker images can contain environment variables which are used to define and create certain 
    elements, in this case the variables are used to create a postgres user and define the data location.

volumes: these are used to keep data persistent by storing the data​ in the host machine and linking it with the 
    container. 
    There are 2 type of volumes that you can create, you can specify the location on your host machine or let 
        docker create the volume for you, in this case docker is used to create the volume called odoo-db-data, 
        this volume is linked to a path within the container where the postgres data is stored 
        (/var/lib/postgresql/data). When creating a volume using docker it needs to be defined, which is done 
        at the very bottom of our yml file.

odoo18:
    image: odoo:18.0
    depends_on:
      - db
    ports:
      - "8068:8069"
    volumes:
      - odoo-web-data:/var/lib/odoo
      - ./config:/etc/odoo
      - ./addons:/mnt/extra-addons
    command: odoo -d odoo_db -i base --db_user=odoo --db_password=odoo --db_host=db

odoo18: is the container name.

image: the docker hub image name and tag(version number).

depends_on: makes this container dependent on another container, in this case the db container must be first 
    initialized before the odoo container.

port: maps containers port to host port, in this case we are mapping containers port 8069 to 8068 on the host 
    machine.

volumes: here we are using both docker defined volume and our own defined volumes in the current directory such 
    as the ./config and ./addons directories​, in the config directory we will include custom odoo settings and 
    mapping it to the odoo config directory inside the odoo container, inside this odoo config we will include 
    the odoo data directory and custom addons directory which we mapped with our odoo-web-data and 
    ./addons volumes (odoo config file explained further bellow).

command: this allows us to run commands inside the container, this particular command ​uses the postgres user to 
    create odoo_db database, the -i base flag is used to initialize the data base and must be removed after 
    running it once, otherwise the database will be recreated and data will be lost.
